# 🎙️🌍 Voice-Enabled Geospatial Map App

## 📜 Overview
This voice-enabled application allows users to search for locations using voice commands. It captures spoken location names, retrieves their geographic coordinates using Nominatim, and displays these locations on an interactive Folium map, which opens in your default web browser.

## 🌟 Features
- **🎤 Voice Recognition**: Uses `speech_recognition` to capture and recognize spoken location names.
- **🔊 Text-to-Speech**: Provides feedback using `pyttsx3`.
- **🗺️ Geocoding**: Converts location names to coordinates with `geopy`.
- **📍 Map Creation**: Generates and displays maps with `folium`.

## 📁 Files
- **`main.py`**: Main script to control the app flow.
- **`speech_utils.py`**: Functions for speech recognition and text-to-speech.
- **`geo_utils.py`**: Handles geocoding to get coordinates.
- **`map_utils.py`**: Manages map creation and opening.
